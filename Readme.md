### üë§ Account Management
- Support for multiple user accounts
- Secure master password protection
- Individual encrypted storage for each account
- Easy account creation and deletion

### üéØ Password Management

- Import capability for backup restoration
- Encrypted backup format

## Security 
* **Strong Key Derivation with scrypt:** We use scrypt to derive the encryption key from your master password. Scrypt is computationally expensive and resistant to brute-force attacks, even if an attacker gains access to the encrypted data.
* **Salting:**  A unique, randomly generated salt is used for each account, further enhancing the security of key derivation.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Go:** [Go 1.20 or higher](https://go.dev/dl/) is required to build Kryptos.
* **Fyne Dependencies:** Ensure you have the necessary dependencies for Fyne development set up on your system. Refer to the [Fyne Getting Started Guide](https://developer.fyne.io/started/) for detailed instructions for your operating system.

### Installation

**1. Build from Source:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/kryptos.git
cd kryptos
go build -o kryptos
```

This will create an executable file named `kryptos` (or `kryptos.exe` on Windows) in your project directory.
